#### Yellowstone National Park Silicified Microbes

Dr. Kalen Rasmussen wrote what I would consider to be the epitome of a geomicrobiology study. Titled "Living to Lithified", this work looks how microbial communities and lipid biomarkers shift along different degrees of silicification. I participated in field work sample collection and measurements as well as conducting a portion of the lipid analyses.
