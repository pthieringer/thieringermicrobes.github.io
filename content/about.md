I followed a non-linear path in science to arrive where I am at today.

I thought I was going to be a musician, but then read a pamphlet for being able to do science outside everyday and was hooked. I combined both of my passions and majored in Geoscience while studying jazz guitar while at Skidmore College.

Encapsulating my 2 year break after graduation, I spent time leading bike touring trips for young adults and continued to explore the world by wheels. I would consider this my first real teaching experience - one without a chalkboard and ... . It is also where you very quickly learn the needs of all of your students, learning to improvise and cater so that everyone can get the same fulfilling experience. The classroom is very much a two-way learning opportunity and knowing how to facilitate a positive ...

Graduate school marked my endeavors into the realm of Geobiology. I learned about the microbial world surrounding us by having the privilege to visit all different types of field sites around the globe - from mines, hydrothermal pools, to ophiolites. In particular, I focused on subsurface ecosystems in dynamic and extreme environments 

I had the opportunity during my postdoc to continue exploring subsurface systems, instead directing my efforts towards marine environments. I investigated microbial members that exist in the deep oligotrophic ocean - also subject to extreme high hydrostatic pressures. Here, I also gained the opportunity to learn cultivation techniques for growing marine archaea working with high-pressure chambers to mimic deep ocean conditions.
